Nektarios Plevritis – Python Developer (Finance Background)

Location: Athens, Greece
Looking for: Remote junior roles in fintech / data / backend
Available: Immediately

I’m currently transitioning from finance into Python development after ~3.5 years as a financial analysis and accounting. 
Most of the work I’ve done so far involves financial data (P&L, balance sheet, sales analysis, risk analysis, ad hoc BOD requests) dashboards, and small automation in ERP system.

I work in leetcode solves and small apps to learn the fundamentals of quant development

Current Projects (in progress)

Volatility dashboard – exploring HAR model + basic ML on intraday data

Simple crypto arbitrage scanner – testing orderbook differences across exchanges


Paper-trading bot (Python) – rule-based for now, experimenting with adding ML later

Payments fraud toy model – using common public datasets to practice feature engineering


LeetCode Progress

~24/150 solved

Mostly Arrays, Hashing, Two-Pointers, Stack, Sliding Window

Goal: reach >100 by Feb 2026
